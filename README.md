# Piranha Backend

Example of how to just use Piranha as content backend in ASP.NET Core. This project was
created with the empty template:

~~~
dotnet new piranha.empty
~~~

After the project was created the following modifications were made:

1. Modified `Startup.cs` to remove application routing
2. Added new `StandardPage` model.
3. Added two `.cshtml` Razor Pages to the `Pages` folder.
